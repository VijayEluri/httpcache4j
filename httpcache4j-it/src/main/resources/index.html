    <p>
      The container has the notion of a flat file system.  Files are not structured in directories; they are ignored.
      So you can PUT to /somefile or /my/directory/somefile and you would actually be putting the same resource.  Directories
      are used for something completely different; namely enabling parts of HTTP.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example if you want to enable use of the "Last-Modified" header you can GET your resource from the "lm" directory:
      <tt>GET /lm/somefile</tt> will give you a "Last-Modified" header.  Also if you send in the "If-Modified-Since" header with
      the same date as "Last-Modified" then you will get a <tt>HTTP 304 NOT MODIFIED</tt> response as specified by HTTP.
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise if you GET your resource from the "etag" directory you will get ETag responses based on the checksum of the file,
      and the server will perform If-Match and If-None-Match requests accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>The following list of directories are supported:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>cc[,<em>seconds</em>]</tt></dt>
      <dd>Cache-Control header.  The response will get a Cache-Control: max-age=18 response (or the number of seconds</dd>
      <dt><tt>error,<em>code</em>[,message=SomeMessage]</tt></dt>
      <dd>Error Response Generator.  Returns the specified error, optionally with a specific message.  For example /error,503/.  Also <tt>slow-error</tt> which adheres to the sleep directory.  Also the <tt>unconditional-error</tt> which </dd>
      <dt><tt>etag</tt></dt>
      <dd>Entity Tag support. The responses will get ETags and the requests are processed for preconditions If-Match and If-None-Match</dd>
      <dt><tt>lm</tt></dt>
      <dd>Last Modified support.  The responses will get Last Modified headers and the requests are processed for preconditions using If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since</dd>
      <dt><tt>sleep[,<em>seconds</em>]</tt></dt>
      <dd>Slow Origin Server.  Full responses will simply be delayed for a few seconds while conditional methods (304, 412) return immediately. (also <tt>unconditional-sleep</tt> which sleeps no matter what</dd>
      <dt><tt>surrogate</tt></dt>
      <dd>Surrogate support.  The requests are checked for Surrogate-Capability and if we find a surrogate that supports ESI/1.0 we add a response header indicating that we want the content to be processed by that surrogate</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Example Conversation</h2>
    <p>Here is an example conversation between a user agent and this web application.  First we PUT some text to the file "hello.txt"</p>
    <pre>
PUT /hello.txt
Host: localhost

Hello World!
------------------------------------
204 No Content
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT
    </pre>
<p>
  We can now GET it if we like:
</p>
<pre>
GET /hello.txt

---------8&lt;---------------------
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:40:45 GMT
Content-Length: 12
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello World!
</pre>
<p>
  The actual headers will probably vary based on your application server and user agent.
</p>
<h3>Last Modified</h3>
<p>
   The GET request can now be enhanced with a "Last-Modified" date by accessing the "hello.txt" file in the "lm" directory:
</p>
<pre>
GET /lm/hello.txt

---------8&lt;---------------------
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:40:45 GMT
Content-Length: 12
Content-Type: text/plain
Last-Modified: <b>Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT</b>

Hello World!
</pre>
<p>
  It is now of course possible to construct a Conditional GET which will trigger the server 304 response.  We take the
  Last-Modified header of the response and put it into the If-Modified-Since header of the request:
</p>
<pre>
GET /lm/hello.txt
If-Modified-Since: <b>Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT</b>

---------8&lt;---------------------
304 NOT MODIFIED
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:45:12 GMT
Last-Modified: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT

</pre>
<h3>Entity Tags</h3>
<p>
  Let's add entity tags by GETting the response from the "etag" directory.  It's the same resource that's why I can
  reuse the If-Modified-Since from the previous example even though it looks as if I'm accessing a "different" resource.
  Both /lm/hello.txt and /lm/etag/hello.txt are the same "thing" and have the same modification dates etc.
</p>
<pre>
GET /lm/<b>etag</b>/hello.txt
If-Modified-Since: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT

---------8&lt;---------------------
304 NOT MODIFIED
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:45:12 GMT
ETag: <b>"ffffffffc63cb61d"</b>
Last-Modified: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT

</pre>
<p>
  Since it was a conditional GET (If-Modified-Since) I didn't get any content but only updated headers: ETag.
  The ETag is simply a hashcode of the content, and the string "Hello World!" gets the ETag <tt>"ffffffffc63cb61d"</tt>.
  We can now construct a conditional GET which relies on ETags instead:
</p>
<pre>
GET /lm/etag/hello.txt
<b>If-None-Match: "ffffffffc63cb61d"</b>

---------8&lt;---------------------
304 NOT MODIFIED
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:45:12 GMT
ETag: "ffffffffc63cb61d"
Last-Modified: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT

</pre>
<p>
  Conditional ETag matching is quite cool.  The cache can keep the last 10 representations in the hopes that one of
  them might go back in style.  If so it sends the ETags of all of the cached responses as follows
</p>
<pre>
GET /lm/etag/hello.txt
If-None-Match: <b>"782f2dcc2"</b> "ffffffffc63cb61d" <b>"ffdb49dc" "a3cdbeef6"</b>

---------8&lt;---------------------
304 NOT MODIFIED
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:45:12 GMT
ETag: "ffffffffc63cb61d"
Last-Modified: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT

</pre>
<p>
  The response from the server indicates which of them to use to the client by setting the ETag header just as it
  would given the full entity.
</p>
<h3>Cache Control</h3>
<p>
  The "cc" directory enables a simple cache control which gives you 18 seconds of cache.  It only affects responses:
</p>
<pre>
GET /cc/hello.txt

---------8&lt;---------------------
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:45:12 GMT
Cache-Control: max-age=18

Hello World!
</pre>
<p>
  You can also specify the max-age parameter as follows:
</p>
<pre>
GET /cc,100/hello.txt

---------8&lt;---------------------
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:45:12 GMT
Cache-Control: max-age=100

Hello World!
</pre>
<h3>Surrogates and ESI</h3>
<p>
  There is preliminary support for surrogates by accessing any resource from a 'surrogate' directory.  Surrogate checking
  is only possible if you actually send in the "Surrogate-Capability" header.  Typically proxies use this to tell origin
  servers that they are there and that they can do post processing.  If an origin server finds out that it wants to use
  this functionality it adds a "Surrogate-Control" header in the response to tell it that it should activate one or more
  transformations on the response before it is passed back to the client.
</p>
<p>
  The surrogate support in the web application simply looks for a surrogate with the capability of processing ESI/1.0 and
  returns all of that surrogate's capabilities in the Surrogate-Control header.  Let's just take a look at an example!
</p>
<pre>
GET /surrogate/hello.txt
Surrogate-Capability: varnish="ESI/1.0 Joe/2.0"

---------8&lt;---------------------
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:45:12 GMT
Surrogate-Control: content="ESI/1.0 Joe/2.0"

Hello World!
</pre>
<p>
  As you can see the entire set of capabilities (ESI/1.0 and Joe/2.0) are echoed back to the server.
  If the surrogate does not support ESI/1.0 then we don't consider it.  Here we have a surrogate which doesn't support ESI and
  the response does <em>not</em> ask for any processing.
</p>
<pre>
GET /surrogate/hello.txt
Surrogate-Capability: varnish="VARNISH/1.0 Joe/2.0"

---------8&lt;---------------------
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:46:34 GMT

Hello World!
</pre>

<p>
  Finally, you can of course combine these things by adding stuff to the path.  The order of the path is not important, as
  the order is strictly defined by the application itself (it checks for ETags before it checks for Last Modified and so on.
  Here's a request with all of the options enabled:
</p>
<pre>
GET /surrogate/cc,180/etag/lm/hello.txt
Surrogate-Capability: foo="ESI/1.0"
If-Modified-Since: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 12:37:45 GMT
If-None-Match: "ffffffffc63cb61d"

---------8&lt;---------------------
304 NOT MODIFIED
Connection: close
Cache-Control: max-age=180
Date: Fri, 09 Nov 2007 14:27:28 GMT
ETag: "ffffffffc63cb61d"
Surrogate-Control: content="ESI/1.0"

</pre>
<p>
  As you can see the 304 response correctly includes the Surrogate-Control header indicating that the origin server still wants
  surrogates to do ESI processing.
</p>

<h3>A Slow Origin Server</h3>
<p>
  It is possible to simulate a slow origin server by accessing anything from within the /sleep/ directory.  The sleeping server
  is configurable; it is possible to tell the origin server to sleep for a specified number of seconds.  By default the server
  will sleep for five seconds.  Here are some example URIs to help you get going:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><tt>GET /sleep/hello.txt</tt></dt>
  <dd>Returns the hello.txt resource after five seconds.</dd>
  <dt><tt>GET /sleep,10/hello.txt</tt></dt>
  <dd>Returns the hello.txt resource after ten seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  Slow origin servers can come in handy when testing for timeout and stale/freshness.  By default the slowness does <em>not</em>
  affect conditional methods where a HTTP 304 is returned.  If you want HTTP 304 to be slow as well, use the
  <tt>unconditional-sleep</tt> keyword which is the same as <tt>sleep</tt> except that it always happens.
</p>
<h3>Error Responses</h3>
<p>

  It is possible to generate arbitrary error codes on the server by accessing the /error/ directory.  You can also add
  the HTTP response code you want as a parameter:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><tt>GET /error/hello.txt</tt></dt>
  <dd>Returns a HTTP 500 error code.</dd>
  <dt><tt>GET /error,503/hello.txt</tt></dt>
  <dd>Returns HTTP 503</dd>
  <dt><tt>GET /error,400,message=Oops,rate=50/sleep/hello.txt</tt></dt>
  <dd>Returns "HTTP 400 Oops" half of the time</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  Errors can be useful when testing how a surrogate reacts to different types of errors.
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to specify the failure rate in percent when GETing a resource: /error,rate=10/ will return HTTP 500 error codes
  ten percent of the times.  The rest of the times the GET will proceed as usual.
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to specify a binary pattern which describes the error response rate specifically:
  You can tell the resource to work once and fail several times, to allow for populating caches.  This is useful if you want to
  test how errors are handled when there is stale content in the cache.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><tt>GET /error,pattern=0011/hello.txt</tt></dt>
  <dd>The first and second requests will fail; then two will succeed, then two will fail and so on. </dd>
  <dt><tt>GET /error,404,pattern=0100000000000000000/hello.txt</tt></dt>
  <dd>The GET will fail once (404), then work once (200) and then fail quite a lot of times (404)</dd>
</dl>
<p>
  There are three different keywords available for errors:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>error</dt>
  <dt>Use this if you want the slow origin server to respond _fast_ to these errors</dt>
  <dt>slow-error</dt>
  <dt>These errors take into account errors taking a long time to generate.</dt>
  <dt>conditional-error</dt>
  <dt>Allow conditional methods to respond with HTTP 304 NOT MODIFIED without error, these errors are when serving the response
    entity.</dt>
</dl>
<p>
  It is possible to combine them into quite erratic origin server behaviour:
  <tt>GET /lm/sleep,3/unconditional-sleep,1/error,503,rate=10/slow-error,404,rate=10/conditional-error,rate=50/</tt>  This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>10% of the time, the server will respond with 503 immediately (error returns immediately on errors).</li>
  <li>Otherwise 10% of the requests will sleep for 1 second and then return HTTP 500.</li>
  <li>Of the remaining requests, any conditional methods will succeed (still after 1 second</li>
  <li>Of the remaining requests, half will fail with  HTTP 500 (also after 1 second)</li>
  <li>The rest will return 200 OK :-) (after 1 + 3 = 4 seconds)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you need to debug, simply replace rate= with pattern= and give all the error paths different patterns (011, 101, 110) so
  each error condition happens once in every three requests.
</p>
  </body>
</html>
